# Detect-and-track-curved-lanes
Detecting curved lane lines using advanced methods: camera calibration, distortion correction, color-space transformation, polyfitting pixel distribution


Overview
---

This code can detect and track curved lane lines; works best during ilumnated conditions. Needs some modifications to operate under shadows.
